# 2024W_Doing_Data_Science_group_Project
As a final project in the Doing Data Science course, we worked with a team on Credit Card Fraud Prediction: https://peter-gy.github.io/static/uni/2024w/dds/analysis.html

## Project Overview

The problem at hand is credit card fraud prediction. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones based on the given dataset. The expected benefits of this project include:

- Reduced financial losses for credit card companies and cardholders  
- Improved customer trust and satisfaction  
- Enhanced security measures for credit card transactions  
- More efficient allocation of resources for fraud investigation  

Fraudulent transactions often stand out due to unusual patterns like sudden large amounts, frequent purchases in quick succession, or transactions originating from unfamiliar locations, making fraud detection a complex task. The issue is further complicated by data imbalance since fraudulent transactions are much rarer than legitimate ones. This imbalance needs careful management to avoid bias in model training. Important features such as transaction amount, location, time, merchant details, and historical customer behavior are crucial for improving model accuracy. Additionally, any solutions must comply with data privacy regulations like GDPR, which dictate how personal data is managed. The ever-evolving strategies of fraudsters require fraud detection systems to be regularly updated and adapted. Achieving a good balance is essential to minimize false positives, which can annoy customers, and false negatives, which can cause financial losses.
